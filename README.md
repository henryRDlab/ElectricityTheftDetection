# Electricity Theft Detection
This is a realistic electricity consumption dataset released by State Grid Corporation of China (http://www.sgcc.com.cn/). 
This dataset contains the electricity consumption data of 42,372 electricity customers within 1,035 days (from Jan. 1, 2014 
to Oct. 31, 2016). Please download all the three zip files (data.zip, data.z01 and data.z02) and unzip them together.

For more details about this paper, please refer to our paper "Wide and Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Electricity-Theft Detection to Secure Smart Grids" (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8233155/).

Please cite our paper when you use this dataset.
